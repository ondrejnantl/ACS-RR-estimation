# ACS-RR-estimation
Respiratory rate estimation using the dominant frequency within respiratory frequency range from spectrum created by multiplication the spectra of approximations of respiratory signals from ECG and PPG

Algorithm was created as semestral project for a subject Advanced Analysis of Biological Signals at FEEC at The University of Technology in Brno, Czech Republic

Algorithm is implemented in function RRestimate

Performance of the algorithm can be evaluated using script evalBIDMC on BIDMC PPG and Respiration Dataset (https://physionet.org/content/bidmc/1.0.0/) and script evalCapno on CapnoBase IEEE TBME Respiratory Rate Benchmark (https://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5683/SP2/NLB8IT)

Documentation in Czech is available in attached PDF file
