# ACS-RR-estimation
Respiratory rate estimation using the dominant frequency within respiratory frequency range from spectrum created by multiplication the spectra of approximations of respiratory signals from ECG and PPG

Algorithm was created as semestral project for a subject Advanced Analysis of Biological Signals at FEEC at The University of Technology in Brno
