function breathVAL = RRestimate(fs, PPG, ECG)
% Estimate of respiratory rate [breaths per minute] from a one minute 
% section of signal
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This function estimates the respiratory rate as dominant frequency within
% respiratory frequency range from spectrum created by multiplication  
% the spectra of approximations of respiratory signals from ECG and PPG
% 
% Respiratory signal is gained by approximating baseline wander of biosignal 
% by interpolating consequent peaks of biosignal by cubic spline
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Input: 
% fs - sampling rate of biosignals as integer, must be the same for both 
%      input signals
% ECG - input ECG signal as vector with length Nx1, where N is the number 
%       of samples
% PPG - input PPG signal as vector with length Nx1, where N is the number
%       of samples
% Output:
% breathVAL - estimated average respiratory rate as double
